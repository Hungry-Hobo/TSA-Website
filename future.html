      <p>Despite the possible setbacks it may have, AR has a very bright future. With the increasing power of technology and the advent of new wearable devices, AR is shaping up to be a very prominent part of our future.</p>

      <h1>Devices</h1>
      <p>Numerous AR devices are currently in the works. While our smartphones can be used for AR, many companies are developing wearable AR devices that allow us to use the current functions of AR without having to carry our phones in front of our faces. One of the most famous examples of this is the Google Glass, a pair of glasses with a small screen in one corner that displays information. Although Google Glass has fallen off the wayside recently, a new device has taken up the reigns as being the foremost wearable AR technology: the Microsoft Hololens. Although much larger than Google Glass, and so much less likely to be used when out and about, the Hololens will provide a much more robust AR experience, with full 3D graphics. As computer technology further develops, the advanced technology of the Hololens may one day be able to fit in a device the size of the Google Glass, allowing for more convenient use in public spaces.</p>

      <h1>Interacting With Objects</h1>
      <p>AR could change the way we interact with objects, and our world. AR devices could be used to scan an object in the real world, and give the user information about it. For example, you could go into the store to buy something, and you could use your device to display information about its cost, how people rated it, and more on the fly. It could also be useful for travel. If you wanted to get information on places to visit, eat, or wanted to get facts about a nearby landmark, all you would have to do is use your device and it would give you all the information you need. It is currently difficult for devices to pick out specific objects in the environment, but there will definitely be a boom in its use when a better method for object recognition is made.</p>

      <br>
      <p>Whether AR is very close to what we have today, or totally unrecognizable, one thing is certain: AR will have a huge impact on us and our society.</p>
