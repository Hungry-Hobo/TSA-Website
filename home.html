      <p>Since the advent of computers, scores of new innovations have been changing how we live. The internet, smartphones and the continuously increasing power of computers have all changed how we live and participate in society. A new innovation, AR, has been rising in popularity and power recently, and is helping to pave the way for the future.</p>
      <h1>What is AR?</h1>

      <p>Augmented reality, or AR for short, is a real-life view of our world that is augmented with computer graphics or other form of media in real time. This can be in the form of a 3D model made to look like it's placed in the real world, a display to provide information to the user, or more.</p>
      <p>Augmented reality is not to be confused with virtual reality and alternate reality (which also uses the acronym AR). Virtual reality, or VR, is an entirely computer-generated view that attempts to immerse the user in another reality with some form of device that allows the user to look around in a 3D environment, and occasionally motion controls. Alternate reality is most commonly used in alternate reality games, or ARGs, where multiple forms of media are used to solve puzzles, such as a game, videos, or even the real world.</p>

      <h1>How Does AR Impact My Life?</h1>
      <p>Although still in its infancy, AR has the potential to grow into a technology that we use every day. It is only being used sparsely now, but, with technologies such as the Google Glass, Microsoft Hololens, and even smartphones, AR can, and most likely will, come to be a technology that impacts us daily.</p>
