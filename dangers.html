      <p>Although promising, AR still has many risks that we need to consider.</p>

      <h1>Obscured Vision</h1>
      <p>Wearable AR devices, such as Google Glass, have the potential to harm users by obstructing their view with graphics. This is a fairly obvious risk, as wearable AR devices constantly show graphics and notifications that could get in the way of the user's view. It's very dangerous to obstruct the user's central view, as they won't be able to focus on objects not in their peripheral view. You also cannot tuck things into their peripheral vision, as it is crucial to determining the size and distance of objects in our view. Both of these scenarios put the user in danger, and could cause them to be injured or even killed. One possible solution, a method that is commonly used with fighter pilots,  to this is to have the view be in the user's central vision, and make it only out of simple lines and a few characters. This would give the user their peripheral vision back, and keep their central vision from being too obscured, while still displaying the necessary information. Whatever solutions the designers use, they will need to keep the user's safety as a top priority.</p>

      <h1>Theft</h1>

      <p>Another possible danger of AR is the likelihood of theft while you're using it. If you're using your phone for AR, you would most likely be holding up high in front of yourself. This could make you a potential target for theft, as potential thieves would see you holding up an expensive device for everyone to see. When using AR on their phone, users will need to exercise caution to keep themselves from being a victim of theft.</p>
      <h1>Privacy</h1>
      <p>AR also poses a potential threat to our digital privacy and security. An example of this worry lies in Pokemon Go's information requirements. Pokemon Go requires the use of the phone's GPS in order to be used, but it has been found that the app tracks your location even when your phone is locked. This raised concerns over the fact that if somebody who wanted to use the information gathered from the app maliciously somehow got a hold of the data, it could potentially put all the people who play the game at risk. If AR is going to require a lot of personal info we have to consider the possibility of that information getting into the wrong hands.</p>
