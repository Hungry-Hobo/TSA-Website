      <p>Although it's still in its infancy, AR already has many uses that show huge promise. From gaming, medicine, education and more, AR is very much paving the way of the future.</p>

      <h1>Gaming</h1>
      <p>AR has a very high potential for making games much more immersive, and allowing players to be more social. A very good example of this is Pokemon Go, one of the most, if not the most, successful uses of AR. In Pokemon Go you would walk around the real world, and catch Pokemon. When you found one, the game would a view from the phone's camera with the Pokemon added in, making it look like the Pokemon is in the real world. At its highest, Pokemon Go had 21 million players, coming close to some of the most popular social media apps. Pokemon Go saw its millions of players joining in meetups, teaming up against each other in competition, and more. This and another one of the games the developers (Niantic) made, called Ingress, show the plausibility of games that allow you to traverse the real world, and view elements of the game through the camera as if they were in the real world.</p>

      <h1>Education</h1>
      <p>AR is also currently being used to enhance education. One very good example of AR being used in education is the Augmented Reality Development Lab, or ARDL. ARDL, backed by companies such as Google and Microsoft, aims to allow teachers to display 3D objects in the real world to help educate. AR can also be used on field trips, allowing for a more complete interaction between students and the location they are visiting.</p>

      <h1>Medicine</h1>
      <p>AR can also help save lives through its uses in medicine. When training new doctors and nurses, AR can be used to display information over different parts of the body to help the trainees learn about it. AR could also assist doctors in being more precise during surgeries, making them more safe and efficient. AR can also be used to help people with various ailments manage better in life. An example of this is VA-ST, a company that produces visors that improve legally blind people's vision by adding outlines around objects to make them easier to see in low-contrast environments.</p>
